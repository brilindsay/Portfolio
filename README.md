Portfolio projects

1. Analysis of CSV data for cycling:
Throughout this project i analyised mutliple data sets combinding them to display different relationships and analysis them. i found the analysis for this data extreamly intresting, it combined many datasets and defenitly taught me alot about combinding dataframes. i found completing the graphs and analysising their output informative and showed that you cant make assumptions about a relationship between variables as often what i thought would be the outcome was in accurate. while i had minimal issues with the coding of this assignment as i was able to find a significant proportion of nessesary code in previous practicals, that could be adjusted for these data sets. i did have an issue commiting my work, showing me i need to educate myself in how this works and the solutions to the errors that often occur. i would also like to develope my analysis skills as to be able to extract as much information from outputs and my ability to clean data to ensure acurate data sets.

2. Data driven prediction models of energy use of appliances in a low-energy house: this project focused on recreating a snipit of an academic artical on the energy use of appliances, recreating plots and a liner regression model. i found the creation of many of the plots very interesting and interpreting the reults of the linear regression very intreaging. i learnt alot about manipulating plots through re creating the plots. however this project showed that i need to expand my knowledge in plot mainpulation and i have since researched different ways plots can be adjusted.

3. Predicting the Genre of Books from Summaries through this project i utilised different prediction models to predict a genre of a book based on the summary. i found this project enlightening as it taught me alot about the models and how they can be used to predict values. i would really like to expand my knowledge on different models so i would be able to utilise a wide variety of models for different projects.

4. working with a team, i lead an exploration into the link between covid-19, public transport usage & road fines issued. throught his project i explored my leadership skills while applying knowledge previously developed. i particularly enjoyed applying models to the data to extract predicters for covid 19 cases.
